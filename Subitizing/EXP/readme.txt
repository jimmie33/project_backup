This code is for collecting annotations about the number of salient objects in images.

Instruction:

1. Each subject should choose a name, e.g. "john".
2. Launch Matlab and go to the directory that contains this file.
3. Type in Matlab:
    expSBT john
4. A UI window will appear, and by clicking start, you will immediately start a task session.
5. Each task session will take you a couple of minutes to complete.
6. You can start the next session at any time that is convenient to you.
7. After completing all the sessions, please email me the results contained in './data'.


For each subject, a tutorial session will be first given. You can exit any session in the middle and no results will be saved.

During the experiment, each image will appear for a very short time (0.5s). You are asked to tell how many salient objects you have seen in the image. There will be five options:

0: No salient object.
1: A single salient object.
2: Two.
3: Three.
4: Four and above.
Not sure: whenever you are not sure about the answer

Salient objects are any objects standing out from the background. If there are many objects in the image, but you do not see any object standing out and attracting your attention, then choose 0.

Sometime the counting can be ambiguous, e.g. a man on a motobike. You can either think of them as a whole object or two different ones. The rule of thumb is to use the number that first come into you head.
